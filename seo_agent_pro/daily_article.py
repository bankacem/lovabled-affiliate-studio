daily_article.py

Generates ONE new article per run, using the confirmed-working Bluesminds
gpt-4o model, and writes it directly into the site's content structure in
the exact frontmatter format public/content/articles-index.json expects
(see scripts/sync-articles.ts for the authoritative schema).

Designed to be run by .github/workflows/daily-article.yml on a daily
schedule. Does NOT push or open a PR itself - that's the workflow's job,
so this script stays a pure "generate one article" step that's easy to
test locally too.

Usage:
