"""
Learning & Memory Agent — persistence layer.

Three tiers, from simplest to richest, on purpose — no external services
(no Pinecone/Weaviate account, no Search Console/SerpAPI key exist for this
project yet), so this has to work standalone:

1. cycle_log.json   — the source of truth. One JSON object per pipeline run
                       (keyword, model used, evaluator score, issues found,
                       whether it was published). Plain JSON, diffable,
                       git-friendly — no binary blobs committed to the repo.

2. lessons.md       — human-readable, accumulating rules. Whenever the
                       Evaluator finds an issue that isn't already covered by
                       an existing lesson, the Learning Agent appends a new
                       one here. This file is injected verbatim into the
                       Content and Optimizer agents' system prompts on every
                       future run — so a mistake made once becomes an
                       explicit instruction from then on. This IS the
                       self-improving loop; it just doesn't need a vector DB
                       to work.

3. Chroma (ephemeral, in-memory) — built fresh at the start of each run from
                       cycle_log.json, not persisted to disk. Used by the
                       Research Agent to semantically retrieve past cycles
                       relevant to the current keyword ("have we written
                       about something like this before, and what did the
                       critic say about it?"). Rebuilding from JSON every run
                       instead of persisting a Chroma DB directory keeps the
                       repo free of binary database files while still giving
                       real semantic retrieval during each run.

Auto-updated by the Learning Agent whenever the Evaluator finds a new class
of issue. These rules are injected into the Content and Optimizer agents'
prompts on every run. Do not delete entries by hand without checking
cycle_log.json — they exist because a real published article violated them.

- Every internal or external link MUST resolve to a real, existing URL. If
  you don't know a real internal article to link to, write the sentence
  without a link rather than inventing a "#" placeholder — a dead link on a
  published page is worse than no link.
- Never write an image with a placeholder src like "image-url-placeholder"
  or similar. If you don't have a real image URL, don't include an image at
  all.
- The full <title> tag is `{seo_title or title} | ExtensionTo` and MUST stay
  at or under 60 characters total (46 for the title itself). If the natural
  title is longer, write a shorter seo_title — don't just leave it unset.
