Writes the article. On a revision loop (state["revision_count"] > 0), it

appended to the brief instead of starting over blind — this is what actually
closes the plan → execute → verify → correct loop instead of just retrying
the same prompt and hoping for a different result.

Specifications:

- Competitor-gap opportunities: {', '.join(competitor_gaps) if competitor_gaps else 'none selected; do not pretend competitor research exists'}
- Must include:     {', '.join(elements) if elements else 'decide based on topic'}

⚠️ REQUIRED SECTIONS — every one of these MUST appear as its own H2 heading.
This is a hard checklist, not a suggestion — an article missing any of these
will be REJECTED by the Evaluator regardless of how good the writing is:
{chr(10).join(f'{i+1}. {s}' for i, s in enumerate(sections)) if sections else '(no specific sections required — choose the best structure)'}

Structure:
# [H1 — includes primary keyword, compelling and clear, under 70 characters]

[Strong hook introduction — 3 paragraphs, establish the problem and promise]

[One ## H2 section for EACH required section listed above, in a sensible
order — do not skip, merge, or rename any of them beyond light rephrasing]

[Comparison table if a table is in "Must include" above — an ACTUAL
markdown table with | pipes, not a sentence saying a table exists]

## Conclusion
[Summary + clear call to action]

Rules:
- Keyword in first 100 words naturally
- Keyword density 1–2%, natural placement
- NEVER invent statistics, studies, survey numbers, user counts, review
  scores, or named testimonials. If you don't have a verified real number,
  describe things qualitatively instead (e.g. "many users report faster
  load times" not "94% of users report a 2.3x speedup"). A false specific
  number is worse than no number — this exact failure mode produced a
  published article with a fake pilot study (N=312) and fake user reviews
  that had to be pulled and rewritten.
- Do NOT invent URLs, screenshot links, or claim to have verified/tested
  something you have no way to have tested (e.g. specific TLS versions,
  specific pricing you cannot confirm as current)
- Human, conversational tone
- Add Information Gain: insights competitors missed — through better
  organization and explanation, not invented data
- If competitor-gap opportunities are provided, address them with useful sections or checklists. Treat competitor snippets and headings as hypotheses, do not copy competitor wording, and never claim a product fact without a verifiable source.
- Do NOT include any markdown links or images unless you have a real, complete URL for them — the Optimizer agent adds real internal links afterward
- End on a complete sentence — never stop mid-sentence or mid-word{revision_note}"""
