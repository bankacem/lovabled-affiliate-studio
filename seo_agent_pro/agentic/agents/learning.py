"""
Learning & Memory Agent.

Runs once per full graph execution (after the evaluation loop settles, pass
or fail). Two jobs:

1. Append a record to cycle_log.json — the permanent, factual history of
   every run (Tier 1 memory). This is what relevant_past_cycles() searches
   and what articles_written_count() counts.

2. Turn deterministic Evaluator failures into permanent lessons. LLM
   qualitative issues ("the intro is a bit generic") are logged for the
   record but NOT auto-promoted into lessons.md — they're too
   context-specific and noisy to safely generalize without a human reading
   them first. Deterministic issues ARE promoted automatically because
   they're already phrased as reusable rules (that's what made them checkable
   by regex/lookup in the first place).
