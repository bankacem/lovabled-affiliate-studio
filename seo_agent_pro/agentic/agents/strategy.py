        "'interactive' anything, downloadable PDFs/cheat sheets, embedded "
        "screenshots/GIFs, or live widgets — asking for these forces the "
        "writer to fabricate fake evidence of features that don't exist, "
        "which has caused real published-content problems before.\n\n"
        "SAME REASON, ALSO FORBIDDEN: quantitative benchmarks (CPU/memory "
        "numbers), cost-benefit/ROI calculations, and named case studies. "
        "This pipeline has no way to actually run performance tests or "
        "source real case-study data, so asking for them produces the "
        "same fabrication failure mode — invented numbers presented as "
        "measured data. Qualitative comparisons (Low/Medium/High, general "
        "pros/cons) are fine; specific invented figures are not.\n\n"
        "SIZE CONSTRAINT (equally important — a brief this pipeline has "
        "actually failed to deliver on before): this is written in a "
        "single pass by one model call, including smaller/faster models. "
        "Keep ideal_length between 1000 and 1800 words, and "
        "required_sections to at most 6-8 H2 headings — roughly one "
        "section per 150-250 words. A brief asking for 20+ sections in "
        "2000 words is not achievable in one pass: the writer either cuts "
        "the article short (truncated mid-sentence) or thins every "
        "section down to a fragment. A focused 6-section, 1400-word "
        "article that's actually complete beats an ambitious 20-section "
        "outline that never gets finished.\n\n"
        "When real competitor research is available, use the top-five snapshots as evidence. "
        "Turn only defensible missing gaps into 1-3 competitor_gap_requirements. "
        "Treat snippets and headings as hypotheses, never as proof of product facts; "
        "do not copy competitor wording or claim a competitor feature without a source. "
        "If research is unavailable, leave competitor_gap_requirements empty rather "
        "than pretending the model inspected search results.\n\n"
        "unique_angle should be ONE differentiating idea in 1-2 sentences "
        "(e.g. 'focus on remote-work-specific pain points competitors "
        "ignore') — not a second checklist of extra sections, data "
        "points, or features layered on top of required_sections. It "
        "gets shown to the reviewer as directional color, not as a "
        "literal list of additional deliverables to grade against."
