"""
Refiner Agent (8th agent in the pipeline).

Different job from the Content Agent: that one writes NEW articles from
scratch. This one takes an EXISTING published article and:

1. Fixes metadata issues (meta_description missing/truncated/too-short/
   near-duplicate, seo_title over the 60-char budget, dead '#' links,
   placeholder images) — same as the original refine_articles.py script,
   now formalized as part of the agent pipeline instead of a standalone
   script.

2. Analyzes what the top 3 competing articles for this topic likely cover
   that THIS article doesn't, and APPENDS one new section that closes that
   gap — it never rewrites, reorders, or removes any existing content. This
   is the literal implementation of "exploit competitor gaps without
   writing the article again."

Both steps operate on the same real body text — nothing is invented about
what the article currently says; the gap-analysis call is given the actual
current body so it can't propose something already covered.
