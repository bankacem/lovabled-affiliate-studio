"""
Evaluator & Critic Agent.

Deliberately does NOT write or fix anything — it only inspects the state the
Content/Optimizer agents produced and decides approve/reject. This is the
node that did not exist anywhere in the pipeline before today, and its
absence is the direct, confirmed cause of every concrete bug found in the
first article this system published (86-char title tag, two "#" dead links,
a fake image src, a hardcoded category).

Two layers, deliberately kept separate:
  - Deterministic checks: exact rules we already know from real incidents
    (regex/length/lookup checks — cheap, 100% reliable, zero LLM cost).
  - LLM qualitative checks: things that need judgment (Information Gain,
    tone, whether the angle actually delivers on the brief).

A deterministic failure alone is enough to reject, regardless of the LLM
score — hard rules don't get overruled by a "but it reads well" opinion.
